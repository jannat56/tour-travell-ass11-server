				<h3> Travell services {element}</h3>
				<p>
					A travel agency is a private retailer or public service that
					provides travel and tourism-related services to the general
					public on behalf of accommodation or travel suppliers to
					offer different kinds of travelling packages for each
					destination
				</p>
				<h3> Ticket booking {element2}</h3>
				<p>
					Those fees range per agent from approximately $25 to $75 per
					ticket.‚Äù The other advantage of using a travel agent? They
					are able to provide discounted or free amenities or
					adventures for the trip.
				</p>
				<h3> Agency Fee {element3}</h3>
				<p>
					And while most travel agents do impose a service fee,
					varying from $25 to $100 depending on factors such as your
					desired itinerary and budget, ultimately, they can help
					maximize savings with exclusive promotions, perks and
					inventory that isn't available to the public, Richter says.
